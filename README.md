# Real-World Build 2: Footprint Logger with Accounts

## Scenario:

Due to user interest, you're now building a full-stack version of the Footprint Logger. This
version should support user registration and login, allow users to save activity logs to their own
accounts, and compare their footprint to a community average.

## Your Task:

Use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to:
● Build authentication routes (register, login)
● Securely store and retrieve user-specific activity logs
● Show a user dashboard with their logs and a total emissions summary
● Calculate and display an average emission level across all users
● Ensure there is a view for weekly summaries or streak tracking
● Simple leaderboard of low-footprint users
Submission Instructions:
Please be sure to push your code to a public GitHub repository and submit the repo link on
Google Classroom for grading.
