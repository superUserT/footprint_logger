# Real-World Build 2: Footprint Logger with Accounts

## Scenario:

Due to user interest, you're now building a full-stack version of the Footprint Logger. This
version should support user registration and login, allow users to save activity logs to their own
accounts, and compare their footprint to a community average.

## Your Task:

Use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to:
● Build authentication routes (register, login)
● Securely store and retrieve user-specific activity logs
● Show a user dashboard with their logs and a total emissions summary
● Calculate and display an average emission level across all users
● Ensure there is a view for weekly summaries or streak tracking
● Simple leaderboard of low-footprint users
Submission Instructions:
Please be sure to push your code to a public GitHub repository and submit the repo link on
Google Classroom for grading.

## How ot run the project

```
npm i
```

```
npm run start

Part 3:
Real-World Build 3: Footprint Insight Engine
Scenario:
Your platform now has consistent users. They’re asking for smart suggestions to help reduce
their emissions. You’ve been asked to build an insight engine that automatically analyses user
activity and provides weekly tips based on their highest-emission behaviours.
Your Task:
Extend your full-stack app to:
● Analyse a user’s activity log each time they log in (or weekly)
● Identify which category (e.g., food, travel, energy) has the highest emissions
● Display a short, personalised tip or goal (e.g., “Try cycling twice this week to cut 2kg
CO2”)
● Set and track weekly reduction targets
● Provide a real-time tip display via WebSockets
● Add a simple “Weekly Goal” section that updates based on user activity

Deployment Instructions:
Please deploy your full-stack app using the free tier at https://render.com. Connect your GitHub
repo to Render for automatic deployment. Ensure your front end and back end are both live and
publicly accessible.
Submission Instructions:
Please be sure to push your code to a public GitHub repository and submit the repo link and
your live Render deployment URL on Google Classroom for grading.
